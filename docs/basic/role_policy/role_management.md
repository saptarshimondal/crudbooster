# Role Management
You can limit a user access with role management. As a default, each user in CRUDBooster have to relate to a role.

To make a role, enter **Developer Area > Manage Roles > Add Role**

There are 5 types of privilege. **Browse**, **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete**.

And you don't need to make a code to prevent a user manually. All those things are handled by CRUDBooster.
